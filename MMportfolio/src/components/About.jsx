        Who am I? Well, from a professional stand point, I am a skilled web developer with around 18 months of non-stop training. I made the pivot from digital marketing to web development, when I stumbled upon an opportunity working as a CMS content mananger for the biggest hospital in New England.
        When I saw that I had the ability to change content on the web that other peopke were using, this was when my light bulb moment went off!
        I haven't looked back since. I wanted to learn more, so I took it upon myself and enrolled in a full-time intensive full stack bootcamp back in August of last year.

          <ServiceCard key={service.title} index={index} {...service} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
